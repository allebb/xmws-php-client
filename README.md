# XMWS PHP Client

*I will shortly be working on an improved XMWS client!*

XMWS stands for ZPanel(X) (M)odular (W)eb (S)ervice, XMWS is implemented in ZPanelX (and the [Sentora](http://sentora.org) fork) to provide a modular approach for both core and third-party modules to expose web service endpoints for such actions as:

* Creating a new hosting account
* Creating a new domain
* Deleting a MySQL database
* Updating an existing mailbox
* etc. etc.

This PHP API client provides what aims to be an easy to use, PHP client library (a simple class to connect to a given server and make web service requests using XMWS), the API client also has a few utility methods to enable the developer easily handle XML data using standard PHP arrays.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3.x
